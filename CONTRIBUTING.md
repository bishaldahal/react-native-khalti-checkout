## Development Process

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+
- Expo CLI
- Android Studio (for Android development)
- Xcode (for iOS development, when iOS support is added)

### Setting Up the Development Environment

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/bishaldahal/react-native-khalti-checkout.git
cd react-native-khalti-checkout

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the module
npm run build

# Set up the example app
cd example
npm install
cp config.example.json config.json
# Edit config.json with your test credentials

# Start the example app
npx expo start
```

### Making Changes

1. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature`
2. Make your changes
3. Add tests for your changes
4. Run tests: `npm test`
5. Build the project: `npm run build`
6. Test in the example app
7. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
8. Push to the branch: `git push origin feature/my-new-feature`
9. Submit a pull request

### Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing code style
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Keep functions small and focused

### Testing

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Test on both Android devices/emulators
- Ensure example app works with your changes
- Test error handling scenarios

### Commit Messages
